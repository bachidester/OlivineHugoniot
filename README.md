# OlivineHugoniot

These jupyter notebooks illustrate data fitting and error propogation for the pressure-density-temperature relation on the principal Hugoniot of olivine from Chidester et al. (in prep). 

"Example absorption correction and temperature calculation, Z Machine" uses a streaked visible spectrum output from SMASH. It corrects for the absorption of light in the olivine sample and calculates the shock temperature of olivine relative to an in situ quartz standard. 

"Olivine data analysis" uses Monte Carlo methods to fit Us-up and T-Us data on the principal olivine Hugoniot. 

"Predictive Impedance Match Calculation" uses the Us-up fit of olivine from 'Olivine data analysis" with the known equations of state of aluminum and quartz to calculate the shock state of sample stacks for a given flyer velocity on the Z Machine.

The rest of the files are needed to run the codes.
